# intiMET

Created by Cathy Duan and Hannah Moran. 

intiMET is a web app created as a final project for the class Software Design. The aim of the project was to begin to understand and learn how to develop a successful web app with an interactive frontend and logical backend. 

The goal of intiMET was to provide a unique experience to navigate the MET's online collection of items.
